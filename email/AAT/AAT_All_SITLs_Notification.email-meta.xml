    <subject>Action: SITL Group Review of Application Review Form for {!Forms__c.Application_Name__c} {!Forms__c.Name}</subject>
    <textOnly>An Application Review form has been approved by the Local SITL and submitted to all SITLs. Please review the application to determine if your program or region has a duplicate application. Then, within five (5) business days of receipt of this message, please select one of these options on the form:
1.  I donâ€™t have a duplicate application, please proceed.
2.  I don&apos;t have a duplicate application and want to be on the Review Group.
3.  I have a potential duplicate application and want to be on the Review Group.

If you do not respond in that timeframe then we will assume that you concur. You may record comments if you so desire. The Review Group will then have ten (10) business days to come to consensus about how to proceed with developing this application or to reject it. If the Review Group does not come to consensus in that timeframe then the CIO will work with the Review Group and others to determine how to proceed.

Note: A copy of this email was sent to the Application Owner and Local SITL as a courtesy.

To access the form use this link: {!Forms__c.Link}
