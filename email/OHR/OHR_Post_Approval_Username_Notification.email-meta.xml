    <textOnly>Congratulations! You now have access to the Federal Personnel Payroll System (FPPS). Your role in the Requesting Office process for SF-52 and awards determines your level of access and options available. Please follow these instructions to verify your account, set a new password and initiate the self-service password reset function.

OHR ITD Security Team Notes: {!if(Forms__c.Comments_1__c=&quot;&quot;, &quot;FPPS ​ACCESS WAS GRANTED AS REQUESTED.&quot;, Forms__c.Comments_1__c)}

Link to FPPS: https://webfpps.ibc.doi.gov/

Username: {!Forms__c.New_UserID__c}
(*USERIDs may end with the number Zero “0”, not the letter “O”)

Password: Will be sent via separate email message for security reasons.

Please log into the FPPS system using the username and password provided. You will be required to change your password on initial login. Your new password must be exactly 8 characters in length, start and end with a letter, and have a number somewhere in between. Examples are f00tball or dog11dog (please don’t use these passwords.)

After successfully logging in and changing your password, the next step is to initiate the self-service password reset function. Log out of the FPPS system (File, Exit or type Exit in the command box.) Navigate to the following link and follow the instructions to establish your identity, create security questions, and enable the self-service password function for your account. Passwords must be changed every 60 days in FPPS, so this step will be beneficial in ensuring that you do not get locked out of your account.
