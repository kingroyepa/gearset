After successfully logging in and changing your password, the next step is to initiate the self-service password reset function. Log out of the FPPS system (File, Exit or type Exit in the command box.) Navigate to the following link and follow the instructions to establish your identity, create security questions, and enable the self-service password function for your account. Passwords must be changed every 60 days in FPPS, so this step will be beneficial in ensuring that you do not get locked out of your account.
