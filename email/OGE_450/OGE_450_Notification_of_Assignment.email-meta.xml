    <subject>You have been assigned an OGE 450 (Confidential Financial Disclosure Report)</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},

Your Deputy Ethics Official has determined that you must file a Confidential Financial Disclosure report (OGE 450). The EPA Ethics Office will no longer accept paper reports, so you must use the new electronic system to file your report. To start your report, log into the EPA Business Application Platform and select “New Form” next to “OGE 450”. You must submit your report by {!Contact.Ethics_Disclosure_Filing_Due_Date__c}.

Training on how to file the e450
Whether you’re a first-time filer or an incumbent filer new to the Business Application Platform, please refer to the e450 training materials available for filers in FedTalent. You can also see whether your particular question has already been asked on the Ethics Program e450 Information Page.

Troubleshooting If you have any technical issues while using the system, please contact e450 Tech Support. If you have any questions about the substance of the report, or if you believe you’ve received this assignment in error, please contact your Deputy Ethics Official.

Thank you for doing your part to prevent financial conflicts of interest and losses of impartiality as you carry out your EPA duties. We appreciate your taking the time to complete your report accurately and timely.

Regards,
Your EPA Ethics Officials</textOnly>
