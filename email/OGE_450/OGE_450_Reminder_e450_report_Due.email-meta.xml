    <subject>Reminder: Your OGE 450 report is due</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},

Just a friendly reminder that your OGE 450 report is due on {!Contact.Ethics_Disclosure_Filing_Due_Date__c}. To start your report, log into the EPA Business Application Platform and select “New Form” next to “OGE 450”. If you’ve already started your report, but have not yet submitted, you may access the existing draft by selecting “My Forms”.

Training on how to file the e450
Whether you’re a first-time filer or an incumbent filer new to the Business Application Platform, please refer to the e450 training materials available for filers in FedTalent. You can also see whether your particular question has already been asked on the Ethics Program e450 Information Page.

Troubleshooting
If you have any technical issues while using the system, please contact e450 Tech Support. If you have any questions about the substance of the report, or if you believe you’ve received this assignment in error, please contact your Deputy Ethics Official.

Thank you for doing your part to prevent financial conflicts of interest and losses of impartiality as you carry out your EPA duties. We appreciate your taking the time to complete your report accurately and timely.

Regards,
Your EPA Ethics Officials</textOnly>
